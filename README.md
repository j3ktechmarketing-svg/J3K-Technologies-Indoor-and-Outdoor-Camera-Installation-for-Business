Key advantages include:
- Improved visibility across indoor and outdoor areas  
- Reduced theft and unauthorized access  
- Clear documentation for investigations and compliance  
- Greater awareness of daily activity and operations  

A well-planned surveillance system becomes part of overall risk management rather than a standalone tool.
